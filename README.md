# SwiftUI Parallax Scrolling

This repo is used for the "Fun with GeometryReader" series on my website: https://www.bigmountainstudio.com/members/posts/12948-getting-started-with-swiftui-s-geometry-reader-part-1

This repo contains the assets needed to start the Parallax Scrolling example, specifically in Part 3.

In Part 3, you learn to build this:

So download the image assets in the Images folder and follow this series and build a cool parallax effect!
